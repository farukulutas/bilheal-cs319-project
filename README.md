## Development Workflow

There are two essential branches on the repository. The `main` and `develop` branch.
* `main` branch reflects the production version of the website
* `develop` branch reflects the staging version of the website

The rest of the branches are created as part of feature development. A modified version of GitFlow pattern was used where every task/feature was separated into a branch and then merged into `develop` using a PR.

From the requirement analysis and design reports, a list of tasks were made on Linear. All of the tasks had a priority, category, difficulty level and an assignee. Linear automatically created a GitHub branch name for each task. Once the task was completed, a PR was created from the branch, reviewed by someone else from the team and merged into develop.

Once the `develop` branch is stable, it is merged into `main`.
